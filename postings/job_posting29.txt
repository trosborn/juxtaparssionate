Job: Senior Backend Engineer (Rails) - Zesty | Zesty is re-inventing the way companies serve food. We use serious technology to let every startup provide exceptional, healthy food like Google does. We’re less than 18 months old and we already serve hundreds of companies in the Bay Area, including names you know like GitHub, Heroku and Slack. Every day, Zesty has to figure out exactly the right set of meals to order for each company, balancing variety, cost, health, dietary restrictions, and automatically learning from individual employee feedback. Then, we need to get thousands of meals from a distributed network of restaurants to hundreds of startups, all before lunch-time, using crowd-sourced transportation. This is a massive logistics and constraint satisfaction problem and we’re building deep technology that will let us do it better than anyone. If you’re interested in building the kind of back-end systems that power Uber and Lyft, Zesty is a way to get in on the very ground floor of an engineering team with similar challenges. So far our tech is all built by a tiny crack team of Oxford mathematicians. You’d be one of the first 5 engineers to join and would work closely with our founders.
