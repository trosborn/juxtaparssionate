<title>Job: Sr. Back-End Developer - Part Time  - Gravity Ward</title><div class="listing-container">
    <div>WE ARE GRAVITY WARD</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>We think we’re awesome; we think you will too. </div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>We are six, intensely independent former freelancers who started Gravity Ward in order to do things smarter. We have a diverse background, from agencies, to video games, to manufacturing. We’re always looking for the best - hardware, software, libraries, business processes, cars, and even clothiers. We choose our clients and projects carefully. We work with people we like, doing work we think is awesome. We’re a distributed team split between Austin and Chicago. Not local either? That’s ok. We’ll figure it out.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>OUR WORK &amp; OUR CLIENTS</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>They’re good, but we’re working hard to make them great. We’re currently building several products for our clients that range from web apps to complex manufacturing systems. And we have a “white whale” that we talk about quietly, behind closed doors.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>WE NEED YOU. YEAH, YOU.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>You are a great Back-End Developer. You’re adaptable, a quick study, and like diving into the deep end and figuring things out. You ask “Why”. You don’t just take a spec or design and build what’s handed to you. You want to know how it works and more importantly, why. You often think you have a better way of executing and can explain it clearly. We thrive on that. Solutions are more than just software to you. It’s about the people, and the problems that you can solve for them.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>Your responsibilities will include working with our team of UX designers and front-end developers to design and build back-end support for client and internal projects. You must be able to create clean, maintainable, and testable code. You will be working on multiple projects at the same time, either as a member of a team and occasionally individually. You must be self-motivated and comfortable with remote-work tools like: Slack, Hangouts, DropBox, Trello, etc.</div>
