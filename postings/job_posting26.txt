Job: iOS / Android Developer - Mokriya Inc | About Us Mokriya takes software seriously. We’re pragmatic crafters who believe in smart and focused development, building clients’ products just as we do our own: investing heavily in design, iterating rapidly to validate and falsify ideas, and pursuing perfection in every interaction. We believe that well-made software can change the world, no matter how small or simple a product might be. We also believe that poorly-made software —badly-designed, badly-developed, or badly-supported— is a preventable tragedy. Mokriya’s mission is to make great software: for ourselves, for our clients, for their users, for the world. About You You love to build. When you're not at your job, you're probably tinkering on some contraption in the basement or figuring out how to take apart &lt;insert-something-you-bought-recently&gt;. You get a thrill from figuring out a clever way to solve a problem. And you really take pride in knowing the ins and outs of iOS or Android. Why should I be excited to work here? First, it’s fun. Not in the “everyone pretend to have fun, we’re a startup, where are the Nerf guns?” way, either. It’s fun to work at Mokriya because beyond the perks and good times, we’re a happy team of people who love to design and build great products. It’s not just that we have an awesomely flat organizational structure in which everyone is *really* empowered to act; it’s also that we hire for fit and bring folks on only if we’re confident in their integrity, capability, and drive. No one will watch over your shoulder, but neither will you have to watch over anyone else’s; we’re a talented team of doers. There’s little bureaucracy and no blocking; we work to make sure you can get things done in the way that best suits your preferences and the project needs. And when people have autonomy, room to be creative and reflective, are rewarded well for great work, and can trust and rely on their colleagues, it makes them happy. Shock!
