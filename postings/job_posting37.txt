<div>We're looking for a <strong>Senior Backbone Developer</strong> with a very specific focus on front-end web programming.  If you have a <strong>mastery of JavaScript and deep experience with modern front-end frameworks such as Backbone, Ember, AngularJS, etc.</strong> this is the perfect opportunity for you!</div>

The Ruby/Rails component serves as an API feeding data upstream to Backbone client-side.<br></strong></div>
