<div>Position Description</div>
<div>Ruby on Rails powers a lot of our infrastructure, and we’re always looking for talented Rails developers to help us reach the next level.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>By joining our team, you’ll get the opportunity to work on many of our various Rails projects with a team of highly skilled Rails experts from around the world. At Toptal, we push the boundaries on what’s possible with Rails every single day, and we’d would love for you to help us get even further. The bulk of the work we do on a daily basis is pure back-end development, but occasionally some new UI has to be wired up, so some front-end skills on your part certainly won’t hurt.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>We don’t cut corners, and we don’t make comprises—we create beautifully architectured Rails apps that are polished, fast, well-tested, and a joy to use.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>This is a remote position that can be done from anywhere; however, we do things like <a href="http://www.toptal.com/remote/the-ultimate-remote-culture">rent out hotels in Africa or mansions in Thailand</a>, and you will certainly be invited to come work with us.</div>
