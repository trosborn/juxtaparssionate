Job: Epic Node.js Leader - CleverTech | About You You're comfortable with Node.js (it's a long-term relationship but it still feels like you met yesterday). You also love trying out new languages, frameworks, libraries, and leveraging them off, whenever necessary (keeps the relationship from going dull too). If you're not a native English speaker, you've always felt English classes were like being in primary school again. You've rejected offers from companies like Google, Facebook, or Twitter, because they don’t believe in the power of Remote Teams. You know when to ask more questions and where to look for answers. You've lead teams to success by shipping useful products that meet and extend clients' expectations and want to keep doing exactly that! You understand the advantages of working remotely, and have a good internet connection and some quiet space to video chat or share your screen to do some pair programming. You are ok with working at least 4-5 hours in EST time. About Clevertech We have been around for 14 years and have over 80 developers and designers, scattered all over the world working together.
