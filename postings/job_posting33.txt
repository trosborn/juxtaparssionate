<title>Job: Software Engineer (Java + Solr) - Help Scout</title><div class="listing-container">
    <div>The ideal engineer for this position has a high level of expertise with Solr specifically. We leverage Solr for several tools at Help Scout and are looking for someone that can improve and maintain our implementation as we grow. </div>

<div>Our engineering team is small (10), remote and responsible for supporting the code they write (talking to customers). There is no dedicated QA team, so we expect automated tests to be part of your development process. Due to our size and remote culture, Help Scout is not the right fit for entry-level or junior engineers at this time.</div>

<li>You'll help to maintain the Help Scout APIs (internal and public) within a small team of passionate engineers. Your world includes everything from documentation to new endpoints and performance optimization. All new product features are built on the APIs and we'd like them to be a pleasure for developers to use as well.</li>
<li>The team consists of 10 senior-level engineers. Aside from a couple of weekly check-ins or project updates, you'll be able to work interruption-free. 90% of our communication happens over chat.</li>
<li>You'll be working with product people. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy high quality work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.</li>
