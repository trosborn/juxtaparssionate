<div><strong>About Intellum</strong></div>
<div><strong><br></strong></div>
<div>Intellum is an Atlanta-based company with a development team distributed around the world. We strive to hire the best, regardless of location.  Our clients are incredible teams of people from companies such as Google, NASCAR, AT&amp;T, and Facebook. We are a company of doers and creators. We are not a sales and marketing machine. We believe that enterprise software should help our clients use technology to reach their highest potential and that it should be every bit as enjoyable, powerful and user-friendly as the consumer applications that we use everyday.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>Our main product (Exceed LMS) is built with Rails and processes millions of student enrollments annually in over 11,000 cities and 65 countries. We have been pushing the boundaries of Rails for years now. Our other product, Tribe Social, is built on top of MongoDB and node.js. We also use Redis in many places in our stack.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>We are a small team and maintain the startup feel at our company despite being in business for more than 14 years. We’ve been featured on the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2935-how-intellum-switched-from-making-a-plan-for-vcs-to-making-a-product-for-customers">37signals blog</a> where you can learn more about our history.</div>
