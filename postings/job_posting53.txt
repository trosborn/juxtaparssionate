Job: PHP Developer - Crew | We're always trying to improve Crew. New features, scaling, internal tools, data visualization - whatever you like to work on, we have a little something for everyone on our wishlist. We're also the makers of Unsplash (https://unsplash.com), How Much To Make an App (http://howmuchtomakeanapp.com) and a bunch of other side projects which would love your attention. We use CakePHP, but as long as you're versed in object-oriented PHP and the MVC pattern (Lavavel, CodeIgniter, Symfony, etc) you're golden. Every job includes the usual stuff: healthcare/benefits, competitive salary, mandatory vacation time, and any tools you need. About Crew Crew (https://pickcrew.com) connects the best design and development projects with a handpicked community of vetted freelancers. Many online workplaces pit freelancers against one another, ultimately landing on price as the main factor. This doesn't lead to innovation, but rather, mediocrity.Â  At Crew, we're building a different system. One that values the quality of the work done. Crew unlocks creativity for all by taking care of everything from idea to launch and beyond: smart budget recommendations, professional vetting, step-by-step project management, and on-time payment and delivery.
