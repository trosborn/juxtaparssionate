You hate the corporate bureaucracy of a big company.\n You're so over the chaos and uncertainty of a start-up. You like having reasonable hours and knowing that your job will be around next week.\n Consulting/freelance is not your bag. You prefer to maintain and improve the products you've built rather than hand them off and move on.\n   This is a full-time, 40 hours per week, remote, W2 position with benefits (health/dental/vision/401k).
