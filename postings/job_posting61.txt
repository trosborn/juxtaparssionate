Job: Senior Ruby on Rails Developer - Curated | Who are Curated? Curated helps you publish weekly digests via email and the web. We build software that helps people unleash their expertise and become leading figures in their field. Built off the back of the successful iOS Dev Weekly newsletter, Curated has distilled the process of creating compelling weekly publications. After a successful patron program and launch, we now need another Ruby developer to help us continue this growth. We’re privately funded and proud to be working in partnership with the folks at Litmus. About the role You would be taking a senior position within the Curated development team. We’re a small team right now so there’s plenty of opportunity to shape the product and really make a difference. We offer a competitive salary as well as 23 days paid holiday (in addition to public holidays). About you You should have a strong understanding of Ruby and Rails and have successfully shipped one or more apps using it. We’re not asking for a specific number of years experience, but you should be able to impress us with your app building skills. We are interested in people who have strong product experience, people who have spent a lot of time sweating the details about what really matters to customers. As we are a small team, you should be comfortable tackling a wide variety of development tasks. There will be aspects of front end, back end and even deployment/hosting work with this role. Being a well rounded software developer will be advantageous.  No recruiters or outsourcing companies please.
