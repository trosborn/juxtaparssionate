<div>About Us:<br>
</div>
<div>We are a small team of good-hearted folks with families, working really hard on a product that we're very excited about. We're committed to staying small and nimble, and we have this crazy belief that there are other good-hearted people out there willing to help us get a fair shot against the big corporate players. We hope that resonates with you.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>Working at 17hats means you're collaborating with other A-players, so you won't have to waste time with incompetent nincompoops. You'll have the autonomy to direct your own work without being micromanaged. You'll have the opportunity to flex your technical muscularity while building on your already impressive skillset. And you'll be instrumental in dramatically improving the lives of self-employed people everywhere -- if you're like us, these people are your friends and family, and they need our help.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>Everybody on our team works remotely (US, Canada, and Europe) so where you live doesn’t really matter. That being said, we do need someone who can work California business hours (9am-6pm PST) and who is available for emergencies at night. Our CTO resides in Europe and would like a good night’s sleep! Bonus points if you can curse in Dutch. Even more if you can do it in Canadian.</div>
