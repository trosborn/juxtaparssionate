<strong>Why You Might Be A Good Fit</strong>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Independence. Ushahidi operates under a de facto system of 
commander’s intent. That is, the team agrees upon a goal, but how it is 
accomplished is left largely up to everyone. Nobody will be leaning over
 your shoulder telling you what to do everyday, we expect you to be able
 to do that yourself.</li>
<li>Intrinsically motivated. Ushahidi came from Nairobi, but team 
members work all around the world. If you need to come into an office 
and talk to your boss everyday to stay motivated, this job is not for 
you. If all you need is a crazy cool project, wifi, and coffee, then 
you’ll fit right in.</li>
<li>Ability to get things done and ship. We’d love you to write 
beautiful elegant code every time but at crunch time: getting things 
done matters. You’ll need to pick the right balance between doing it 
right and doing it fast.</li>
<li>Desire to work with the community, dig into their use cases, and 
help them solve problems. Ushahidi has a large and dedicated community 
whose needs have evolved.</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph_break">
<br>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Why You Might Not Be A Good Fit</strong>
</div>
<ul>
<li>We pay competitively at Ushahidi, however, keep in mind that we are still a mission driven non-profit.</li>
<li>You only want to wear one hat. Ushahidi is growing (30+ employees) 
but we take on the goals of much larger organizations. In practice this 
means that all Ushahidians end up wearing multiple hats and working on 
multiple projects (case in point: I am writing this job description). If
 that excites you, great! If you are set on never venturing out of your 
job title, you’re going to get frustrated fast.</li>
<li>You want to be in an office surrounded by colleagues. You will most 
likely be operating on your own unless you are based in Nairobi, where 
about half our team is based.</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>
<strong>Why Working At Ushahidi Is Awesome</strong>
</div>
<ul>
<li>We reward taking risks. Ushahidi works on the bleeding edge of 
technology for social change, that means taking risks with our efforts. 
We don’t celebrate failure, but we definitely celebrate swinging for the
 fences, regardless of the outcome.</li>
<li>Our goal in hiring is to find great people first, great skills second.</li>
<li>We generally don’t care where you live. As long as you have Internet
 access, live wherever you want. Ushahidi team members currently live 
all over the world: from Japan and New Zealand, to Nairobi and San 
Francisco.</li>
<li>We don’t care when you work. There are no “business hours” at 
Ushahidi, we are milestone based, not a sit-in-your-chair from 9 to 5 
company.</li>
<li>We don’t care when you work. There are no “business hours” at 
Ushahidi, we are milestone based, not a sit-in-your-chair from 9 to 5 
company.</li>
<li>Quality of life. Ushahidi attracts workaholics, so we all work hard to make sure everyone has a work-life balance.</li>
<li>Benefits. Take what you want vacation policy (Minimum 25 days a 
year), parental leave, allowance for health insurance, allowance for a 
coworking space.</li>

<strong>About Ushahidi</strong><br>
</div>
<div>Ushahidi started as an ad-hoc group of Kenyan bloggers hammering out 
code in a couple of days from various locations, trying to figure out a 
way to gather more and better information about the 2008 post-election 
violence in Kenya.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>Ushahidi is a non-profit technology company that builds open source 
platforms to help citizens, journalists, organizations, governments, and
 others gather, manage, analyze, and visualize crowdsourced data. Our 
tools have been used by tens of thousands of individuals and 
organizations fighting for social causes in over 159 countries — whether
 for monitoring corruption in Zimbabwe, gathering real-time data on 
local poverty issues, or giving people a voice in the Syrian crisis.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>Everyone at Ushahidi comes to work here because we know that every 
day people around the world use the tools we build to improve the lives 
of millions. In other words, in the fight for a better world, we aren’t 
007, we’re Q.</div>
<div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
<div>Our team tends to think big and rewards creativity and an 
entrepreneurial attitude. Over the past six years, we have also built 
the iHub – the tech community hub in Nairobi, the BRCK – a redesign of 
connectivity for the developing world, and other projects like Savannah 
Fund, AfriLabs, and Crisis Mappers. Our ethos – we don’t just build 
products, we solve problems.</div>
